MUDCrawler
==========

Migrating a very old MUD base from c to java - this is more or less just a do-while-commiting-to-work-and-back project.

## Howto use

build: run 'mvn install' in the ./server directory, this will create a jar package in ./Server/target

execute: start the MUD server using 'java -jar ./server/target/mudcrawler-*.jar'

connect: use any telnet client and connect to your localhost on port 3141 (telnet localhost 3141). then... don't get lost in the depth of Angloor!
